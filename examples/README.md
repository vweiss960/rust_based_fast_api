# poem_auth Examples

Runnable example projects demonstrating how poem_auth integrates with the Poem web framework.

Each example is a standalone Rust binary that can be run independently.

## Running Examples

```bash
cd basic-auth && cargo run
# or
cd login-endpoint && cargo run
# or
cd rbac && cargo run
```

## Examples Coming Soon

Examples are being developed to demonstrate:

1. **basic-auth** - Basic authentication setup with database and JWT
2. **login-endpoint** - Full login flow with token generation
3. **rbac** - Role-based access control patterns

Check the [GETTING_STARTED.md](../GETTING_STARTED.md) guide for step-by-step integration instructions.
